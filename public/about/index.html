“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.”">

      <h3>VISION</h3>
      <p>The God-given vision of Elyon's Heirs Assembly is to raise a Global body of believers committed to a life of Faith based on the word.</p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Bringing people out of darkness into a spirit filled faith walk through spirit filled teaching, preaching, trainings.</li>
          <li>Raise Global body of disciples through mentoring and training to fulfil the great commission</li>
          <li>Equip believers through various empowerment programs to make them effective members of the society</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Our Core Beliefs</h3>
      <ol>
          <li><h4>Salvation by Grace</h4>
              <p>We believe that salvation is a free gift from God, received by faith in Jesus Christ alone. We are saved by grace, not by our work (for by works no man is justified); through His death and resurrection, we are reconciled to God as sons and granted eternal life. Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>God's Grace and Mercy</h4>
              <p>We believe in the power of God's grace, which empowers us to live victorious lives. By His grace, we are made righteous, and we extend that same grace to others in our interactions and relationships. We believe in the mercy of God that has made salvation available to all men. We believe this is captured in the gift of His Son for our salvation. Titus 2:11, Romans 5:15</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>The Holy Spirit</h4>
              <p>We believe the Holy Spirit is the third person in the Godhead. Co-equal to the Father and The Son. We believe in the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. The Holy Spirit empowers us, teaches, rebukes, and exhorts us in all truth, He equips us with spiritual gifts to serve God and others. We believe in the fruits of the Spirit born through our relationship, fellowship, and partnerships with the Spirit. We are called to be filled with the Holy Spirit and live in His power. 2 Cor 13:14, 1 John 5:7</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Christ has made us victorious Over Sin</h4>
              <p>We believe that through Jesus Christ, we have been set free from the power of sin. We are no longer slaves to sin but are empowered to live righteous and victorious lives, reflecting Christ's love and holiness. Rom 6:14</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Prosperity and Abundance</h4>
              <p>We believe that God desires for us to prosper in all areas of life-spiritually, emotionally, mentally and materially. We walk in faith and obedience, and through God's principles of sowing and reaping as a demonstration of our faith in God's infallible word. 3 John 2, Josh 1: 8</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>The Great Commission</h4>
              <p>We believe in the Great Commission and are committed to spreading the gospel to all nations of the Earth. As heirs of God, we know we are ambassadors of Christ and must be busy with our father's business - Soul Winning. We actively engage in evangelism, making disciples, and being a presence of the resurrected Christ in our communities and beyond. </p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Community and Relationships</h4>
              <p>We believe in the importance of fellowship and mutual communion to exhort, build and correct one another in love, as the bible commands us. Hebrews 10:25, Ps 133; 1</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Purpose and Calling</h4>
              <p>We believe that every individual has a God-given purpose and calling. This purpose is only activated in Christ Jesus. It is fulfilled as the believer walks in daily fellowship, reverence and obedience. We are created to fulfill our divine assignments and live lives that make an eternal impact in the world. Jer 1:5, Gal 1:15</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>The Second Coming of Christ</h4>
              <p>We believe that Jesus Christ will return to establish His kingdom on earth. We live in anticipation of His return, keeping our hearts and lives ready, knowing that He will reward those who have faithfully followed Him. Acts 1:11, 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, Matthew 24:30</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>The Bible as the Final Authority</h4>
              <p>We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. It reveals God's will, His thoughts and ways to us; and it is our ultimate guide for faith, conduct, and living a life that pleases God. We commit to studying, applying, and living out the truths revealed in the Bible. 2 Timothy 3:16-17, Psalm 119:89, 2 Peter 1:20-21, John 17:17</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Healing and Miracles</h4>
              <p>We believe in the power of God to heal and perform miracles. We trust that through faith and prayer, God can restore our bodies, minds, and spirits to wholeness, and we encourage one another to seek His healing and restorative power. Mark: 1:23-25, 1 Peter 2:24, Ex 15:26, Exodus 23:25-26</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Baptism of through Immersion in Water</h4>
              <p>We believe in the baptism through immersion in water as a sign of death to the world and the resurrection to a new life. We believe in its a fundamental part of the great commission; as a public demonstration of our faith and commitment to Christ Jesus. Matthew 28:19, Acts 22:1</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Baptism of the Holy Ghost</h4>
              <p>We believe in the Baptism of the Holy Ghost with evidence of Speaking in tongues. We believe tongues are supernatural given to God's children as an unction which should be spoken by faith in praise, thanksgiving, all manners of prayers and supplication. 1 Corinthians 14:2, Romans 8:26, Mark 16:17</p>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Holy Communion</h4>
              <p>We believe the sharing of communion as commanded by the Lord Jesus. We believe in its sacredness of injunction. We believe the bread and the wine eaten by faith is our participation in the body and the blood (Life) of Christ. Matthew 26:26-28, 1 Corinthians 11:23-26</p>
          </li>
