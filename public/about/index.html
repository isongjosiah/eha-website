<p>The God-given vision of Elyon&rsquo;s Heirs Assembly is to raise a <strong>global body of believers committed to a life of faith based on the Word</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is multifaceted, focusing on spiritual growth and outreach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing people out of darkness into a <strong>spirit-filled faith walk</strong> through spirit-filled teaching, preaching, and trainings.</li>
<li>Raising a <strong>global body of disciples</strong> through mentoring and training to fulfill the <strong>Great Commission</strong>.</li>
<li>Equipping believers through various empowerment programs to make them <strong>effective members of society</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="our-core-beliefs">Our Core Beliefs</h2>
<p>At Elyon&rsquo;s Heirs Assembly, our faith is founded on these core beliefs:</p>
<h3 id="1-salvation-by-grace">1. Salvation by Grace</h3>
<p>We believe that <strong>salvation is a free gift from God</strong>, received by faith in Jesus Christ alone. We are saved by grace, not by our works, and through His death and resurrection, we are reconciled to God as sons and granted eternal life.</p>
<h3 id="2-gods-grace-and-mercy">2. God&rsquo;s Grace and Mercy</h3>
<p>We believe in the power of <strong>God&rsquo;s grace, which empowers us to live victorious lives</strong> and makes us righteous. We extend this same grace to others. We also believe in God&rsquo;s mercy, which has made salvation available to all, captured in the gift of His Son for our salvation.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-holy-spirit">3. The Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the <strong>third person of the Godhead</strong>, co-equal with the Father and the Son. We believe in His ongoing work in our lives, empowering, teaching, rebuking, and exhorting us in all truth. He equips us with spiritual gifts to serve God and others, and we believe in the <strong>fruits of the Spirit</strong> born through our relationship with Him. We are called to be filled with the Holy Spirit and live in His power.</p>
<h3 id="4-christs-victory-over-sin">4. Christ&rsquo;s Victory Over Sin</h3>
<p>Through Jesus Christ, we have been <strong>set free from the power of sin</strong>. We are no longer slaves to sin but are empowered to live righteous and victorious lives, reflecting Christ&rsquo;s love and holiness.</p>
<h3 id="5-prosperity-and-abundance">5. Prosperity and Abundance</h3>
<p>We believe that <strong>God desires for us to prosper in all areas of life</strong>—spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and materially. We walk in faith and obedience, demonstrating our faith in God&rsquo;s infallible word through His principles of sowing and reaping.</p>
<h3 id="6-the-great-commission">6. The Great Commission</h3>
<p>We are committed to <strong>spreading the gospel to all nations of the Earth</strong>. As heirs of God and ambassadors of Christ, we are dedicated to soul-winning, actively engaging in evangelism, making disciples, and being the presence of the resurrected Christ in our communities and beyond.</p>
<h3 id="7-community-and-relationships">7. Community and Relationships</h3>
<p>We believe in the importance of <strong>fellowship and mutual communion</strong> to exhort, build, and correct one another in love, as the Bible commands us.</p>
<h3 id="8-purpose-and-calling">8. Purpose and Calling</h3>
<p>Every individual has a <strong>God-given purpose and calling</strong>, activated only in Christ Jesus. This purpose is fulfilled as the believer walks in daily fellowship, reverence, and obedience. We are created to fulfill our divine assignments and make an eternal impact in the world.</p>
<h3 id="9-the-second-coming-of-christ">9. The Second Coming of Christ</h3>
<p>We believe that <strong>Jesus Christ will return to establish His kingdom on earth</strong>. We live in anticipation of His return, keeping our hearts and lives ready, knowing that He will reward those who have faithfully followed Him.</p>
<h3 id="10-the-bible-as-the-final-authority">10. The Bible as the Final Authority</h3>
<p>The Bible is the <strong>inspired Word of God</strong> and our ultimate guide for faith, conduct, and living a life that pleases God. We commit to studying, applying, and living out the truths revealed in the Bible.</p>
<h3 id="11-healing-and-miracles">11. Healing and Miracles</h3>
<p>We believe in the <strong>power of God to heal and perform miracles</strong>. Through faith and prayer, God can restore our bodies, minds, and spirits to wholeness, and we encourage one another to seek His healing and restorative power.</p>
<h3 id="12-baptism-through-immersion-in-water">12. Baptism through Immersion in Water</h3>
<p>We believe in <strong>baptism through immersion in water</strong> as a sign of death to the world and resurrection to a new life. It is a fundamental part of the Great Commission and a public demonstration of our faith and commitment to Christ Jesus.</p>
<h3 id="13-baptism-of-the-holy-ghost">13. Baptism of the Holy Ghost</h3>
<p>We believe in the <strong>Baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues</strong>. Tongues are a supernatural gift given to God&rsquo;s children as an unction to be spoken by faith in praise, thanksgiving, and all manners of prayers and supplication.</p>
<h3 id="14-holy-communion">14. Holy Communion</h3>
<p>We believe in the <strong>sharing of communion as commanded by the Lord Jesus</strong> and in its sacredness. The bread and the wine, eaten by faith, represent our participation in the body and blood (Life) of Christ.</p>
